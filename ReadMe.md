# MIT 6.824 lab 1 and lab 2

This is my implement of MIT 6.824 lab1 Map-Reduce and lab2 Raft.

The program can pass all test of lab1 and lab2.

Because of not familiar with Golang, I didn't use much channel and more depend on logic and mutex lock. Instead, I think this is easier to understand by people.
